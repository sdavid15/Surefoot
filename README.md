Brief Purpose/Description of the Marketing Test
The test was to determine the impacts on 1) Average Order Value (AOV) and 2) Revenue, by comparing shopping behavior of visitors with and without an incentive. The incentive was a free gift for purchases of at least $100, promoted through a new feature added to the client’s store website.
 
Deliverable a.1.1) Average Order Value (AOV) 
Conclusion 1: There was a positive impact on AOV when the visitors chose the free gift incentive (Fig. 3). 
 
Deliverable a.1.2) Total Revenue
Conclusion 2: There was a positive impact on Total Revenue per transaction when the visitors chose the free gift incentive (Fig. 8). 

Deliverable a.2) Incentive-driven spending effect  
Conclusion 3: The free-gift incentive encouraged visitors to add more items to cart to reach $100 threshold (Fig. 10). However, the visitors choosing the free-gift incentive would have spent $100 regardless (Fig. 9).

Deliverable a.3) Alternative metrics explored
Conclusion 4: There are a few other metrics that I would like to specifically consider: 
1.	Impact of Cost incurred –The incentive added a cost factor of $7 per transaction to the client. In the test scenario, when visitors chose the incentive, total cost incurred to the client was $1932. When visitors were shown GWP and preferred not to choose the incentive, it saved the client a cost of $16,604 (Fig. 12).
2.	Quantity of items -The total quantity of items purchased per transaction that amounts to at least $100 when they chose the free incentive was, 57% more than when visitors were not shown the incentive and when the purchased items were at least $100 (Fig. 11).


 
Deliverable a.4) Where will the client go from here?
Recommendations: 
Based on all of the conclusions detailed above, the client may consider offering gift with purchase (GWP) as a regular or seasonal website feature going forward.
  
•	The visitors receiving hats would have spent $100 regardless of the incentive offer (Fig. 9). However, because of the incentive, the AOV increased (Fig. 3) and there was a strong lift in Revenue (Fig. 8). Revenue growth can positively impact the client when AOV increases. Since it is well known that for data-driven businesses, AOV metric helps to set goals and strategies and also to evaluate how well these strategies are working, it is imperative for the client to consider adding “gift with purchase” feature to the website. 

•	The analysis also brought out the fact that a greater number of items were purchased with the incentive (Fig.10). Since we also observe an increase in AOV as mentioned earlier, some of the successful strategies for increasing AOV that can be recommended to the client are cross-selling, upselling, volume discounts, free shipping, coupons and return policy.

•	Another interesting feature that worked towards the client’s benefit was that the cost incurred to client, because of the incentive, was very low (Fig. 12). The client can take advantage of understanding visitor behavior and make this incentive as a seasonal offer rather than a year-round offer after due diligence, which is likely to make the offer more attractive to visitors. As there is a transaction cost of $7.00 associated with Gift with purchase for the client, increasing AOV is a way to drive direct revenue, increase profits and reduce cost, as the visitor is buying regardless.
 

  Deliverable c)  Recommendation on new variables 
•	One variable that would help in meaningful analysis is the duration of the incentive or the Date of the transaction. This will help in understanding visitor behavior of those who tend to choose incentive, which in turn can be used in planning the seasonal promotions of GWP and thus also efficiently manage the cost associated with the free gift for the client, and simultaneously increase AOV.

•	Another variable that can possibly be added is “Visitor names”. This can help in determining the
a.	Return Per Visitor (RPV): It is a measurement of the amount of money generated each time a visitor uses the Client’s website. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of visitors to the site, and is a method of estimating the value of each additional visitor.  
b.	Conversion Rate: It is defined as the total number of visitors divided by the number of conversions made on the Client’s website. The higher the conversion rate, the higher the multiplier of the AOV will be for overall revenue.
